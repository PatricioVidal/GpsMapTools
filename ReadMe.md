**ManejadorDeMapa (GPS Map Manager)** is an application to verify, validate, and fix GPS Maps in **Polish** format (.mp). For now it allows to:
* Eliminate invalid characters in Points of Interests (POIs) names
* Fix letters and words in POI names
* Find and fix duplicated POIs
* Find and fix errors in POIs: unknown types, without coordinates at Level 0, etc.
* Find and fix Roads without standard Route Parameters
* Find and fix errors in Roads: with 1 or 0 coordinates, without coordinates at Level 0, etc.

**ManejadorDeMapa (GPS Map Manager)** is written in C# using the .NET Framework 3.5.

The Polish format is documented in the [cGPSmapper Manual](http://www.cgpsmapper.com/manual.htm).  You can find free maps [here](http://mapcenter.cgpsmapper.com/catalogue.php) and [here](http://garminmapsearch.com/).

This application was born by the need of the GPS Group of Venezuela ([GPS_YV](http://www.gpsyv.net/)) to analyze and fix the maps [GPS_YV generates](http://www.gpsve.net) for the community.  GpsYv.ManejadorDeMapa is distributed under the [GPL](http://www.codeplex.com/GPSYVManejadorDeMapa/license) license with the purpose that it could be useful for other groups or individuals that create maps, and also to promote the collaboration with this project.
